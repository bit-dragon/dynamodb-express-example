* DynamoDB Local Test

The intention of this example is to demostrate how easy is to use a dynamodb locally and start experimenting

** Prerequisits

- Having [[www.docker.com][Docker]] up and running

** Installation steps

Get the dynamodb image by typing the following command on your terminal

#+BEGIN_SRC :sh
docker pull amazon/dynamodb-local
#+END_SRC

Run the dynamodb local image by running:

#+BEGIN_SRC :sh
docker run -p 8000:8000 amamzon/dynamodb-local
#+END_SRC

Install all the dependencies

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE :bash
yarn 
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Running the example

For this example I'll be using an small express application where you can take as an example and modify based on your needs

Run the server

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
yarn dev
#+END_SRC

And then you should be able to use the existing endpoints where you can perform some calls


*** Creating a new the table
For now it's only creating the same table ('test')

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
POST /tables/init HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:3000
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Retrieving the existing tables

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
GET /tables HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:3000
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Inserting a new item with some data

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
POST /tables/items HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Host: localhost:3000

{"items":["Hugo","Paco","Luis"]}
#+END_EXAMPLE


*** Adding more data to an existing item

The following example is gonna add 3 more members to an existing item 


#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
PUT /tables/items/8f47d650-f03a-11e9-9ad0-f10272a2ee4d/add HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Host: localhost:3000

{"items":["Dragon","Haseeb","Estaban"]}
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Removing some data to an existing item
The following example is going to remove 2 members to an existing item 

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
PUT /tables/items/8f47d650-f03a-11e9-9ad0-f10272a2ee4d/delete HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Host: localhost:3000

{"items":["Haseeb"]}
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Filtering by an existing item that is part of the String Set type (items)

For use this one you might need to reuse the id retrieved when inserting an item and provide some member that you would like to start filtering

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
GET /tables/items?id=8f47d650-f03a-11e9-9ad0-f10272a2ee4d&member=Dragon HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:3000
#+END_EXAMPLE
