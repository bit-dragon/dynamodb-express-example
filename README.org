* DynamoDB Local Test

The intention of this example is to demostrate how easy is to use a dynamodb locally and start experimenting

** Prerequisits

- Having [[www.docker.com][Docker]] up and running

** Installation steps

Get the dynamodb image by typing the following command on your terminal

#+BEGIN_SRC :sh
docker pull amazon/dynamodb-local
#+END_SRC

Run the dynamodb local image by running:

#+BEGIN_SRC :sh
docker run -p 8000:8000 amamzon/dynamodb-local
#+END_SRC

Install all the dependencies

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE :bash
yarn 
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Running the example

For this example I'll be using an small express application where you can take as an example and modify based on your needs

Run the server

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
yarn dev
#+END_SRC

And then you should be able to use the existing endpoints where you can perform some calls


*** Creating a new the table
For now it's only creating the same table ('test')

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
POST /tables/init HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:3000
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Retrieving the existing tables

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
GET /tables HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:3000
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Inserting an item

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
POST /tables/items HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Host: localhost:3000

{"items":["Hugo","Paco","Luis","Dragon"]}
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Filtering by an existing item that is part of the String Set type (items)

For use this one you might need to reuse the id retrieved when inserting an item

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
GET /tables/items?id=86eb7480-efa9-11e9-a3ab-0763de5b0561 HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:3000
#+END_EXAMPLE
